# Translation

You can easily translate your project messages and use anywhere.

To do this you need to:

* prepare translation file in [i18n/\<code>/*.php](../i18n);
* set `<code>` as value of `app.lang` parameter in [config/app.php](../config/app.php)

## Translation file

Take a quick look on this sample:

```php
<?php
// i18n/en/errors.php
return [
    'empty_id' => 'ID cannot be empty',
];
```

This file will be `require`d when `app.lang == en` and return an array with keys and strings.

Keys in this array are identifiers of every translated message.
When built, message keys are dot-notated and prepended by filename (e.g. `home.` part of `i18n/en/home.php` path).

This array may be multidimensional.

So when you need to print something you just:

```php
throw new Exception(_('errors.empty_id'));  // php
{{ _('errors.empty_id') }}; // twig
```

The `_()` function can accept array of replacements as second argument.
This might be useful when you have to provide some placeholders and replace them with real data before output.

```php
// i18n/en/hello.php
return [
    'world' => 'Hi, @name!',
];

// somewhere in project
echo _('hello.world', ['@name' => 'Anthony']);

// output:
// Hi, Anthony!
```

If message was not found so key itself will be returned.

## Application language

Language code is name of directory inside [i18n/](../i18n).

It can be set in `app.lang` parameter in [config/app.php](../config/app.php).

You can access current locale object via `Flight::get('locale')`.

You can also use `App\Core\Locale` class to access translations of several languages at the same time:

```php
use App\Core\Locale;
echo (new Locale('en'))->get('some.string').PHP_EOL;
echo (new Locale('ru'))->get('some.string').PHP_EOL;
```
