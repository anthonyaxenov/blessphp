# Configuration

Config files placed in [./config](../config).
There few files with important parameters such as routes, twig parameters, etc.

But most config file is [.env](../.env.example).
This is one of the first file parsed in lifecycle.
These settings has 1st priority but it is ok if this file does not exists because default values are provided for them.
